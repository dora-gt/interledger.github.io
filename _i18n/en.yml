    Interledger is an open protocol suite for sending payments across different <em>ledgers</em>.
    Like routers on the Internet, <em>connectors</em> route packets of money across independent payment networks.
    The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system. Interledger is not tied to any one company, blockchain, or currency.
